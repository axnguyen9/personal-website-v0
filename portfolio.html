      <p><strong>Design&art are not easy.</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: patience! The watercolor painting above took me a year to finish, believe it or not. Some days,
        I sat there mixing watercolors with death in my soul. But with every single brushstroke, it brought me closer
        to the end: some furnished building/bridge/trees (haha). Honestly though, this is one of my proudest works today, and I learned a lot about the constraints + powers of watercolor.
      </p>
      <p>First off, sketching. Sketching can be boring as hell, but it's valuable for providing general guidelines. It's good
        practice to block sections of color together, to add depth to the background and give a visual guide before full-blown painting. Then painting. Ah . . . the struggle between detail, and impressionist-type style. I chose to add details, which taught me how to handle watercolor brushes and paints carefully (Water spreads. Seriously. :O). Generally, watercolor paintings lean toward impressionism, but it's up to artist discretion. It's your work, after all :)
      </p>
      <p>Tip: use different technique to produce different textures. Example: note the bridge v. the water.</p>
      <p>Tip tipper: check perspective. Different structures within the painting may face different angles. Add more sketches if necessary!</p>
      <p>Bigger tipper: water isn't detailed, so wing wing.</p>
      <p>Reminisce: I wish I'd added less detail, because the painting seems to hit you with all the colors. Although I learned way too much about detailed watercolor, next time I think I want to do something impressionist to balance styles. Every week for 3hrs, I sat down and breathed watercolor fumes, and yes the rectangular part of the bridge maybe took 8hrs too long, but in the end, it was worth it. Signing off, struggling artist (just kidding . . . ).</p>
