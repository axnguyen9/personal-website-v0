    <h2>B a c k g r o u n d</h2>
      <p>Technology has always drawn me into its grasp since a child. My dad used to work
      as a computer engineer, so he constantly encouraged me to diagnose my own computer
      issues and set up any new computers I received on my own. I was lucky to grow up with my own PC, which accustomed me to the ups and downs of basic technology. My dad taught me how to install software packages, and how to detect signs of malware. I give lots of thanks to my dad, who pushed me to my potential, and whose unwavering belief in me inspires me endlessly to do my best.</p>
      <p>Still, I never really grasped the power of technology. In high school, I joined the Girls Who Code club, a national organization seeking to decrease the gender gap in technology. The club opened my eyes to the powers of computer science: the magic of creating, the hallelujahs from a program working :D. I realized that computer science was a tool to create impactful projects on society like applications, software, and integrative technologies. I encountered other young women like me, eager to learn but not sure where to start â€“ a community.</p>
      <p>To me, computer science became an art: the keyboard my palette, the code my strokes of paint on a    canvas. Both a program and a painting contain miniscule details that form a bigger picture. And of course, CS & art definitely require lots (L O T S) of *patience*. In the future, I would love to integrate my visual skills in my career. Until then, hello world!!!</p>
